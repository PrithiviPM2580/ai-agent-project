# Build a semantic search engine with LangChain, PDF files, and Gemini

## Overview

This tutorial shows how to use LangChain's document loaders, embeddings, and vector stores to build a simple semantic search over a PDF. You’ll learn to find passages similar to a query and see a minimal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) example using those results.

## Concepts

- #### Documents and document loaders;
- #### Text splitters;
- #### Embeddings;
- #### Vector stores and retrievers.
